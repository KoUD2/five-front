					Imagine that you are preparing a project with your friend. You have
					found some interesting material for the presentation and you want to
					read this text to your friend. You have 1.5 minutes to read the text
					silently, then be ready to read it out aloud. You will not have more
					than 1.5 minutes to read it.

					Many parents do not like their children to play video games. One
					reason is that it is a waste of time. Instead of playing games, they
					could be spending their time wisely, doing homework, exercising, or
					cleaning the house. Another reason is that many games are destructive
					and violent, causing children to behave badly and aggressively in the
					real world. Finally, video games are often addictive and thus
					discourage children from having other hobbies and interests. All of
					these are good reasons to dislike video games. Nevertheless, there are
					some good reasons to allow children to play them. For one thing, not
					all video games are mindless time-wasters. Nowadays, there is much
					more variety and lots of games to choose from that are educational and
					instructive. Parents simply need to spend more time paying attention
					to the kinds of games children play and encourage them to choose games
					that develop their minds.
